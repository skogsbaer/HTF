* 0.15.0.0
  - Remove macros for assertions, location information is now provided
    via HasCallStack. For most users, this change is backwards compatible.
    However, if you imported Test.Framework qualified, then all assert macros
    where previously in scope unqualified, through macros. In this case, you need to
    import Test.Framework unqualified or qualify all uses of assert macros.

  - support for containers-0.4.* (thanks to M. Snoyman)

  - machine-readable output: the --json option provides a way for getting
    machine-readable output in a simple JSON-based format
  - support for subAssert (allows abstraction over assertions but keeps error locations)
  - don't depend on unix under Windows
  - added timing information to the output
  - possibility to list all tests
  - several bugfixes, especially related to location information in presence
    of an extra cpp invocation
  - HTF itself now has a test suite
  - removed upper bounds from .cabal files
  - backwards incompatibilities:
    + Test.Framework now longer exports all of Test.Framework.TestManager and
      Test.Framework.BlackBoxTest. For modules that only define tests, no changes
      should be necessary. However, you likely need to adjust your test runner
      module by importing Test.Framework.TestManager and possibly Test.Framework.BlackBoxTest.
    + Some reorganization in Test.Framework.TestManager and related modules, introduction
      of Test.Framework.TestTypes. Usually, your code should not be affected
      by these changes.

  - Assertions can be run via runTest
  - Support for assertNotEqual
  - Bugfixes

* 0.8.1.1 (2011-11-07)
  - Bugfixes

  - multi-line diff with pretty-printing
  - bugfixes
  - build support for GHC 7.2.1

    the expected and the given value
  - more uniform output

    tests to ignored are prefixed with `--not'

* 0.7.1.0 (2011-07-08)

    Test.Framework.TestManager.runTestWithArgs (simply prefix the

  - minor fix for the tutorial (thanks to Marnix)

    code

  - preprocessor now parses bang patterns

  - added `--hunit' flag to htfpp. (The `--hunit' flag causes assert-like
    macros to be expanded in a way that is backwards-compatible with the
    corresponding functions of the HUnit library.)
  - Some functions in Test.Framework.HUnitWrapper were renamed in a
    non-backwards compatible way. The assert*P functions are now called
    assert*Pretty, and the function assertSetEqual is now called
    assertListsEqualAsSet

* 0.4.0.0 (2010-09-02)
